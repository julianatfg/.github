# 👩🏻‍🎤 Hi
I’m Jules, by the way. I enjoy reading, walking, languages and learning new techy things. I also like Doctor Who and period dramas.

I used to spend my days at LiveJournal (hey, remember that, kids?) and now I spend my days at Github, trying to get better at coding. Or programming. Whatever. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
